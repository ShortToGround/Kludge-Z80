Version 1 is a simple 16k banking system that needs to be initialized first thing on boot, due to the '374's being undefined when first powered on.

I would like to implement a varied banking setup with a masking I/O to allow from 2K up to 32K banks.
This would be selectable on boot.

Also bonus points if I add in circuitry that would have the RAM banking system default to a 32K ROM/RAM map on boot until banks are switched.
Then it could vary between a bog standard Z80 setup all the way up to an OS that could have 2K mallocs for programs!

I fear all of this wouldn't fit in my 100mm x 100mm constraints though.
